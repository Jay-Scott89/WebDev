<!-- 
CSS - Cascading Style Sheets    

    Creating styles inline with each element can is not a good idea most of the time, as a change will be needed across 
    the document instead of just one line and you cant share the styles across pages and would need to be hard writen 

    You can also write the style in the style element, this is an imporbment from the inline but still cant use across pages

    Third option is to create a .css file and have all the style their in a filesheet. and include a <link> in the head of your HTML document.-->
